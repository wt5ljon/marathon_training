# Marathon Training Plan
>Thanks for the time and effort put into planning!  Here are my initial thoughts...

## Excel Schedule
>The weekly mileage, pacing, and time commitments are reasonable and something I believe I can keep up with. I found a 20-week schedule online that I liked and turns out to be very similar to this 16-week schedule.  Here are some similarities and differences between the two.

#### Similarities
* Same number days of running and days of rest per week
* Same days of rest/recovery/cross-train (Mondays and Fridays)
* Same or similar weekly mileage totals

#### Differences
* 20-week vs. 16-week (obviously)
* Online schedule had a longest run of 26 miles (3-weeks prior to race) vs. this schedule's longest run of 20 miles
* Online schedule includes other run workouts (i.e. Bridge work, Track work, Fartleks, etc.)

## Marathon Plan - Areas to Address

#### Race Day Goal
>9:30 pace is a shot in the dark.  I would like to think I could do better but not sure what pace I can sustain for 26 miles.

#### Plan Between Now and Schedule Start Date
>I'm currently running about four days a week (averaging around 20 miles total).

#### Time Committment / Weekly Mileage
>I'm fortunate that I don't have to work so time to devote to this is not an issue.  I'm open to whatever weekly mileage is necessary without over-doing it.

#### Preparation For Race Day
>TBD

#### Hydration/Nutrition
>Very much an area of concern for me since I am not in the habit of taking nutrition during a run.

#### Race Training Schedule
>See EXCEL spreadsheet

#### Other Races
>None planned.  Possibly a few short races (Run the Tide Beach 5K)

#### Best Time of Day to Run/Train
>Prefer early morning.

#### Training Scheduling Conflicts
>The only known scheduling conflict I have is four days (Aug. 19th through Aug. 22th) that I will be out of town and may not be able to train at all.  This is early in the plan.  Could we somehow build this into the schedule?  Possibly start the plan a week earlier to compensate?
